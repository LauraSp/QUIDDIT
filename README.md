## Download

A full manual is available at this address as well.

## Installation instructions
### Install Python
In order to run QUIDDIT, you will need a working version of Python 3.

I recommend installing an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes the most commonly used libraries. To run QUIDDIT, you will need:
* SciPy
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* Tkinter
* webbrowser
All of these are part of the most common IDE for Python. The instructions in the manual were created for use with Spyder (which is part of the Anaconda package), so I recommend installing Anaconda and running scripts with Spyder for users not familiar with coding.

To install Anaconda, visit

chose your operating system and follow the instructions.
